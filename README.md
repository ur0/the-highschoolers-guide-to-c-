# The Highschooler's Guide to C++

Are you a high-school student? Do you find existing books either useless or unnecessarily verbose?
Your search for a to-the-point C++ textbook ends here.

Here's a book on C++, written for school students, by a school student. No programming PhDs required.

## Why this?

Computer programming doesn't need to be a pain to learn. It is one of those subjects that you'll always find useful, even if you don't take it up for your higher education.

However, I've always had problems with CS books. Most of the prescribed books sound insanely boring and winded. Quite a few of them miss the point of learning to program altogether, by focusing exclusively on solving convoluted problems, which often have no real life significance.

This is my attempt at making a book on programming in C++, meant for the average high-school kid. I'm trying to focus more on getting concepts across than preparing you for your doctorate or creating problems that don't exist.
