# What's Programming?

*This is a chapter on computer programming in general. Feel free to skip this if you already know another programming language (MS Logo doesn't count).*

Your computer is a dumb machine. It doesn't know what it needs to do, not unless you (or someone else) tells it. That's programming - telling a computer what it needs to do (and how does it get to doing that).

There are many ways to instruct your computer - we call them languages. Some computer languages resemble English, while some don't. C++ somewhat does.

Also, computer languages have a particular way of being written, called *syntax*. They also have some special words which mean something to the computer, called *keywords*. Don't worry about these terms just yet, we'll get to them.

To sum up, you'll be writing your own *programs* in some *language*, using a particular way of writing (*syntax*) and some special words (*keywords*).

Throughout this book, we'll be writing in this language called C++.
