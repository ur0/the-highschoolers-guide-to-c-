# What's Programming?

*This is a chapter on computer programming in general. Feel free to skip this if you already know another programming language (MS Logo doesn't count).*

Your computer is a dumb machine. It doesn't know what it needs to do, not unless you (or someone else) tells it. That's programming - telling a computer what it needs to do (and how does it get to doing that).

There are many ways to instruct your computer - we call them languages. Some computer languages resemble English, while some don't. C++ somewhat does.
