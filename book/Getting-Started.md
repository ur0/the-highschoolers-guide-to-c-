# Getting Started

  Before we get up and running, we'll have to know about and install a magical program called a compiler.
  
## Compiler
  
  Computers don't directly understand C++. They need a translator, *a compiler* to turn C++ into a language they understand (called a binary). If you want to write your own programs, you will need to install one on your PC. Fortunately for us, there are loads of free compilers out there. They might differ slightly in their specifications, but they do the same thing.
